when compare two files, we can recognise the error by 
recogniting the newly typed code. Bug exists mainly in new codes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: the breakpoints are logical, it is easier to for me to understand 
what was happening when i refered to it later
cons: i may forgot to create commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each 
file separately?
because git provides version control for documents which are inter-
related, for example, coding an app; while documents in Google Docs for 
example, are not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of 
files?
git log --stat can help u see how the files have changed. git diff help 
me to compare different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
that could break something?
because you know you can always go back to the previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using 
Git for?
