What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
everything is recorded. It is for future use.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is the middle place between working directory and repository
it offers a value of letting me make changes such as adding comments 
before turn it into a commit.
